== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Images fail to loading

* Are you using Hostgator? Simply contact their support via phone or live chat to report mod security blockage. Send them the faulty link to a thumbnail.
* If you are not on Hostgator but getting 403 errors then try adding these lines to your .htaccess file in the WordPress installation folder. Revert the modification if it has no effect and contact the hosting's support.

<IfModule mod_security.c>
  SecFilterEngine Off
  SecFilterScanPOST Off
</IfModule>

php_value mbstring.func_overload 2

RewriteRule wp-content/plugins/(.*\.php)$ - [R=404,L]

* Make sure you have GD library. A possible error is "GD Library Error: imagecreatetruecolor does not exist - please contact your webhost and ask them to install the GD library".
