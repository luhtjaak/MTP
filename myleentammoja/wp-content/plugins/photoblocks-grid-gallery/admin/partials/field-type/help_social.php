    Enabling a social network will let users sharing your <strong>page</strong> not your <strong>image</strong>, 
    except for Pinterest and Houzz
    which are the only social networks that will let you share the clicked image.<br>
    For Facebook, Twitter, Houzz and Google+ you can choose the image to use for the whole page by selecting an image of your
    Open Graph Image tag. To set an image for the Open Graph tag you can choose one of the many plugins available, like <em>SEO by Yoast</em>.<br>
    <br>
    Choose "<strong>FancyBox</strong>" as lightbox if you need to let users sharing also from the lightbox.
