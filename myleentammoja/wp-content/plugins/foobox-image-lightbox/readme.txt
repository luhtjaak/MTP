A responsive image lightbox for WordPress galleries, WordPress attachments & FooGallery

== Description ==

FooBox was the first lightbox to take responsive layout seriously. Not only does it scale images to look better on phones, but it rearranges it's button controls to look great in both portrait or landscape orientation.

Works with most image gallery plugins, but works best with our [FooGallery Image Gallery WordPress Plugin](http://foo.gallery).

**New Feature : Complete FooBox Asset Control!**

By default, FooBox includes javascript and stylesheet assets into all your pages. We do this, because we do not know if the page content contains media or not.
If you want more control over when FooBox assets are included, you can now exclude the assets by default, by enabling a setting. Then on each page, you can choose to include them when required.
Alternatively, you can leave the setting disabled, and then choose to exclude the FooBox assets from particular pages. A new metabox is now available when editing your pages or posts.
This new feature was only available in the PRO version beforehand, but we feel control over your website performance is something you should not have to pay for. Enjoy!

**Now includes a 7-day free trial of FooBox Pro!**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `foobox-free` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= FooBox is not working. There is an error in the console "Uncaught ReferenceError: FooBox is not defined" =

Some plugins or themes defer javascript in the page, which causes the FooBox initialization code to run BEFORE the FooBox main script is loaded. This has been fixed in version 1.2.24. Please upgrade.

= My theme has a built-in lightbox and it shows under FooBox. What can I do? =

There is a setting to try and disable hard coded lightboxes, but this is not a sure-fire solution for every scenario. If that setting does not work for you, you might need to deregister certain javascript files, or uncomment certain lines of code in your theme to remove it's lightbox.
